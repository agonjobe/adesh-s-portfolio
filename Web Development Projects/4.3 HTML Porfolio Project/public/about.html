<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A Nurse<br>
A self taught software Engineer to be
</p>

<p>Having worked in Health Care for around a decade i decided to venture into learning a
  new skill of learning software development.<br>
  The Goal is to excell at software development and be one of the best developers in the game.</p>

<p>Growing up in a nomadic rural community of Serichpo, a town in the middle of nowhere, I decided that in my thirties i would like to sit back and raise my kids on my own terms.<br>
 This may mean working remotely. As a nurse working remotely is almost impossible, Working while in Africa is a pipe Dream <br>
This has motivated me to vemture into IT, The only field where this is possible.</p>
